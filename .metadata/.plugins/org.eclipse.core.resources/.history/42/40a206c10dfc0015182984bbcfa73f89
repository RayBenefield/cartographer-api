/**
 * Represents an Xbox Live (XBL) Gamertag, a single user's XBL identity.
 * Gamertag is not case-sensitive for uniqueness, but presentation of the
 * Gamertag is case sensitive.
 * 
 * For example `godlyperfection` is unique and others can't use
 * `GODLYPERFECTION`. However when a Gamertag is created, the casing is locked
 * in for presentation purposes so `GodlyPerfection` would always be displayed
 * for `godlyperfection` if that is how it was registered.
 * 
 * TODO Add 15 character validation.
 * TODO Add invalid character validation.
