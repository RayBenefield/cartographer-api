*** For Production ***

 1) Setup the capi.setup script with s3 bucket creation, Swagger uploading, etc.
 2) Create Read Replica like tables for Raw Data domains
     - Matches
     - PlayerMatches
 3) Setup Getters:
     - Matches
     - MapMatches
 4) Setup all Lambda functions to handle bulk operations
     - PlayerMatchCounts
     - PlayerMatches
     - Matches
     - MapMatches
 5) Expose Getter Bulk operation POST endpoints
 6) Setup the ability to spin up different stages of CAPI (dev, test, prod)
     - CloudFormation updates
     - Configuration updates
 7) Change the JSON output to match the Halo API format (ProperCase keys and better formatted time)


*** Nice to have ***

 1) Fix the SegmentScanner/DomainQueueFiller to deal with Throughput properly
 2) Swagger documentation
 3) Setup the Patreon
 4) Parameters for budgeting (DynamoDB)
 5) Setup Configurations, Outputs of stack, Mappings, and Parameters in a JSON document for scripting access
 6) More time saving scripts
     - capi.disable
     - capi.execute
     - aws.upload (handle uploading all functions, and include shared domain building)
 7) Write the naming convention document
 8) Refactor out the handler business logic into Domain services that are called by the Handlers to make CAPI framework agnostic from Lambda.
 9) Explore the Context and check to see if there is a way to differentiate a test vs an actual execution
 10) Pull out the CAPI Wrapper into its own project
 11) Pull out the Halo 5 Wrapper into its own project
 12) Find a fix to the DynamoEvent test parsing
 13) Setup Unit Testing for all classes
 14) Create Templates:
	 - Reader and Writer Repositories
	 - Dynamo Domain Objects
	 - Specific Repository types like SNS, Dynamo, etc.
 15) Create Snippets:
	 - Lazy IOC and Dependency Injection constructors
	 - Dynamo Attribute/HashKey/RangeKey getters/setters
 16) Add Value Objects to Dynamo Domain Objects with proper marshaling/unmarshaling for "always valid" domain objects
 17) Refactor ObjectWriters out of SnsWriters and redirect them to the generic objectWriters
 18) Circumvent SNSEvent and convert them into domain objects by adding a setRecords(List<SNSRecord>) to domain objects since Lambda parses input out in a particular way
 19) Use Jackson to support Domain Object views for returning API results
 20) Update SegmentScanner to use an actual queue URL instead of a queue URL key to avoid having to upload it for every new queue
 21) Setup Cloudwatch Alarms
 22) Change Game to Match across the entire system
